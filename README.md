# tyin-server
The serverside portion of my home inventory system. Uses express and mongoose to create a REST API which can store data
about inventoried items, and in the future will store places for items as well.

There's a long list of TODOs, but I need to get JWT authentication set up and make sure the API's locked down behind
that before anything else happens.

## Future plans
To make this usable I'm writing a frontend in React Native, specifically for iOS, but theoretically for
any mobile operating system.

## Postman API examples
Located in `api/` - import the `.json` file directly
